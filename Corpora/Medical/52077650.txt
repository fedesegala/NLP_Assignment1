This is a historical timeline of the development and progress of cancer treatments, which includes time of discovery, progress, and approval of the treatments.


== Ancient Era ==
Cancer was traditionally treated with surgery, heat, or herbal (chemical) therapies.

2600 BC  –  Egyptian physician Imhotep diagnosed several types of tumour and therapies for them. According to the Ebers medical papyrus, hard tumours were treated by placing a poultice near the tumour, followed by local incision.
BC  –  Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians used heat to treat masses. Healers in ancient India used regional and whole-body hyperthermia as treatments.
2 AD  –  Ancient Greeks describe surgical treatment of cancer.
