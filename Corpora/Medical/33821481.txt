There are several models of the Branching order of bacterial phyla, the most cited of these was proposed in 1987 paper by Carl Woese. This cladogram was later expanded by Rappé and Giovanoni in 2003 to include newly discovered phyla. Clear names are added in parentheses, see list of bacterial phyla.
