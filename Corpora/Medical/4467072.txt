In microbiology, the multiplicity of infection or MOI is the ratio of agents (e.g. phage or more generally virus, bacteria) to infection targets (e.g. cell). For example, when referring to a group of cells inoculated with virus particles, the MOI is the ratio of the number of virus particles to the number of target cells present in a defined space.


== Interpretation ==
The actual number of viruses or bacteria that will enter any given cell is a stochastic process: some cells may absorb more than one infectious agent, while others may not absorb any. Before determining the multiplicity of infection, it's absolutely necessary to have a well-isolated agent, as crude agents may not produce reliable and reproducible results. The probability that a cell will absorb

        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   can be calculated for a given population using a Poisson distribution. This application of Poisson's distribution was applied and described by Ellis and Delbrück.

        =

    {\displaystyle P(n)={\frac {m^{n}\cdot e^{-m}}{n!}}}
  where 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is the multiplicity of infection or MOI, 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is the number of infectious agents that enter the infection target, and 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(n)}
   is the probability that an infection target (a cell) will get infected by 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   infectious agents.
In fact, the infectivity of the virus or bacteria in question will alter this relationship. One way around this is to use a functional definition of infectious particles rather than a strict count, such as a plaque forming unit for viruses.For example, when an MOI of 1 (1 infectious viral particle per cell) is used to infect a population of cells, the probability that a cell will not get infected is 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        0
        )
        =
        36.79
        %
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(0)=36.79\%}
  , and the probability that it be infected by a single particle is 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        1
        )
        =
        36.79
        %
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(1)=36.79\%}
  , by two particles is 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        2
        )
        =
        18.39
        %
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(2)=18.39\%}
  , by three particles is 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        3
        )
        =
        6.13
        %
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(3)=6.13\%}
  , and so on.
The average percentage of cells that will become infected as a result of inoculation with a given MOI can be obtained by realizing that it is simply 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        n
        >
        0
        )
        =
        1
        −
        P
        (
        0
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(n>0)=1-P(0)}
  . Hence, the average fraction of cells that will become infected following an inoculation with an MOI of 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is given by:

  
    
      
        P
        (
        n
        >
        0
        )

        −
        P

        =

        )
        =
        1
        −
        
          
            
              
                m
                
                  0
                
              
              ⋅
              
                e
                
                  −
                  m
                
              
            
            
              0
              !
            
          
        
        =
        1
        −
        
          e
          
            −
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(n>0)=1-P(n=0)=1-{\frac {m^{0}\cdot e^{-m}}{0!}}=1-e^{-m}}
  which is approximately equal to 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   for small values of 
  
    
      
        m
        ≪
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\ll 1}
  .


=== Examples ===
As the MOI increases, the percentages of cells infected with at least one viral particle also increases.
