=== Post-translational modifications ===
There are a number of post-translational modifications of the c14orf119 protein, all of which are shown on the conceptual translation of c14orf119 in Figure 2.
There are predicted ubiquitination sites at lysine residues at positions 128 and 139.There are predicted kinase-specific phosphorylation sites at serines at the following position in the c14orf119 protein sequence, 15, 19, 27, 32, 36, 81, 83, 90, and 121. Protein phosphorylation at serine residues can play critical roles in the regulation of protein function and the transmission of signals throughout the cell.There are two N-glycosylation sites at positions 25-27 and 48–50. This type of post-translational modification plays important roles in both the structure and function of some eukaryotic proteins.
Additionally, there are predicted glycation of epsilon amino groups of lysines at the following positions, 40, 64, 69, and 139. Glycation is a process in which proteins react with reducing sugar molecules, which ultimately impairs the function and changes the characteristics of the protein.There are also predicted mammalian mucin type GalNAc-O-glycosylation sites at the following positions, 5, 6, 7, 12, 15, 19, and 24. GalNAc-type-O-glycosylation is the attachment of a sugar molecule to the oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in a protein. O-glycans or the sugars added to the serine or threonine, have various functions, including allowing recognition of foreign material, providing cartilage and tendon flexibility, controlling cell metabolism, and trafficking cells in the immune system.There is a predicted SUMOylation sites at the lysine at position 139. SUMOylation is involved in transcriptional regulation, protein stability, apoptosis, nuclear-cytosolic transport, progression through the cell cycle, and response to stress.Finally, there are predicted O-GlcNAc sites at the serines at the following position in the c14orf119 protein, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 83. This post-translational modification can play various critical roles such as, progression through the cell cycle, response to cellular stress, protein turnover, and protein stability.

=== Epigenetic ===
There are varying levels of H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 throughout the c14orf119 gene. H3K4me1 has variation in signal strength among different cell lines, which may reflect differences of epigenetic landscapes in these cell lines. Additionally, there is a strong signal of H3K27ac across the majority of cell lines along the predicted promoter region. Finally, there is also a strong signal of H3K4me3 across the majority of the cell types along the predicted promoter region, with no signal variation across cell types.
