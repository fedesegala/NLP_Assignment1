Wellbeing literacy is defined as the intentional use of wellbeing relevant vocabulary, knowledge and language skills to maintain or improve the wellbeing of oneself, others and the world.  The term was originally coined and published by Prof. Lindsay Oades and colleagues in 2017, who described wellbeing literacy as the potential "missing link" or "missing ingredient" in positive education, and now supports systems-informed approaches to education (2020).More broadly, wellbeing literacy relates to how people communicate about and for wellbeing (2021).Wellbeing literacy is a construct that reflects the intersection between the words that people use to describe wellbeing and the understanding they have of  wellbeing, according to Waters and Higgins (2022).
