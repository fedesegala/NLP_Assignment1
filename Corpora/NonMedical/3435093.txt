A line sheet is a sheet used by a manufacturer in the garment/fashion industry providing information on a product for wholesale sales. It allows a garment to be listed with the sizes in its size range, great for inventory tracking. It typically includes a line drawing or photograph of the product (possibly computer generated), its identification or SKU number, the style, and perhaps a swatch showing color and fabric. In lieu of swatches industry color standards such as Pantone numbers may be used. Price, minimum order amounts, order cutoff dates, contact and delivery information are also included.
A line sheet is a marketing tool that presents the needed information to the potential customer. It is used in both printed and digital formats.
