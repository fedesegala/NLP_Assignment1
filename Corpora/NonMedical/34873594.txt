In geometry, the exsphere of a face of a regular polyhedron is the sphere outside the polyhedron which touches the face and the planes defined by extending the adjacent faces outwards. It is tangent to the face externally and tangent to the adjacent faces internally.
It is the 3-dimensional equivalent of the excircle.
The sphere is more generally well-defined for any face which is a regular
polygon and delimited by faces with the same dihedral angles
at the shared edges. Faces of semi-regular polyhedra often 
have different types of faces, which define exspheres of different size with each type of face.


== Parameters ==
The exsphere touches the face of the regular polyedron at the center
of the incircle of that face. If the exsphere radius is denoted rex, the radius of this incircle rin
and the dihedral angle between the face and the extension of the 
adjacent face δ, the center of the exsphere
is located from the viewpoint at the middle of one edge of the
face by bisecting the dihedral angle. Therefore

  δ is the 180-degree complement of the 
internal face-to-face angle.


=== Tetrahedron ===
Applied to the geometry of the Tetrahedron of edge length a,
we have an incircle radius rin = a/(2√3) (derived by dividing twice the face area (a2√3)/4 through the
perimeter 3a), a dihedral angle δ = π - arccos(1/3), and in consequence rex = a/√6.


=== Cube ===
The radius of the exspheres of the 6 faces of the Cube
is the same as the radius of the inscribed
sphere, since δ and its complement are the same, 90 degrees.


=== Icosahedron ===
The dihedral angle applicable to the Icosahedron is derived by
considering the coordinates of two triangles with a common edge,
for example one face with vertices
