In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the categorical trace is a generalization of the trace of a matrix.


== Definition ==
The trace is defined in the context of a symmetric monoidal category C, i.e., a category equipped with a suitable notion of a product 
  
    
      
        ⊗
      
    
    {\displaystyle \otimes }
  . (The notation reflects that the product is, in many cases, a kind of a tensor product.) An object X in such a category C is called dualizable if there is another object 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            ∨
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X^{\vee }}
   playing the role of a dual object of X. In this situation, the trace of a morphism 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to X}
   is defined as the composition of the following morphisms:

  
    
      
        
          t
          r
        
        (
        f
        )
        :
        1
         
        
          
            
              
                ⟶
              
              
                c
                o
                e
                v
              
            
          
        
         
        X
        ⊗
        
          X
          
            ∨
          
        
         
        
          
            
              
                ⟶
              
              
                f
                ⊗
                id
              
            
          
        
         
        X
        ⊗
        
          X
          
            ∨
          
        
         
        
          
            
              
                ⟶
              
              
                t
                w
                i
                s
                t
              
            
          
        
         
        
          X
          
            ∨
          
        
        ⊗
        X
         
        
          
            
              
                ⟶
              
              
                e
                v
                a
                l
              
            
          
        
         
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {tr} (f):1\ {\stackrel {coev}{\longrightarrow }}\ X\otimes X^{\vee }\ {\stackrel {f\otimes \operatorname {id} }{\longrightarrow }}\ X\otimes X^{\vee }\ {\stackrel {twist}{\longrightarrow }}\ X^{\vee }\otimes X\ {\stackrel {eval}{\longrightarrow }}\ 1}
  
where 1 is the monoidal unit and the extremal morphisms are the coevaluation and evaluation, which are part of the definition of dualizable objects.The same definition applies, to great effect, also when C is a symmetric monoidal ∞-category.


== Examples ==
If C is the category of vector spaces over a fixed field k, the dualizable objects are precisely the finite-dimensional vector spaces, and the trace in the sense above is the morphism
  
    
      
        k
        →
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\to k}
  
which is the multiplication by the trace of the endomorphism f in the usual sense of linear algebra.If C is the ∞-category of chain complexes of modules (over a fixed commutative ring R), dualizable objects V in C are precisely the perfect complexes. The trace in this setting captures, for example, the Euler characteristic, which is the alternating sum of the ranks of its terms:
  
    
      
        
          t
          r
        
        (
        
          id
          
            V
          
        
        )
        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
          
        
        (
        −
        1
        
          )
          
            i
          
        
        rank
        ⁡
        
          V
          
            i
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {tr} (\operatorname {id} _{V})=\sum _{i}(-1)^{i}\operatorname {rank} V_{i}.}

Kondyrev & Prikhodko (2018) have used categorical trace methods to prove an algebro-geometric version of the Atiyah–Bott fixed point formula, an extension of the Lefschetz fixed point formula.
