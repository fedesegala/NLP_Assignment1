In geometry, an abelian Lie group is a Lie group that is an abelian group.
A connected abelian real Lie group is isomorphic to 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            k
          
        
        Ã—
        (
        
          S
          
            1
          
        
        
          )
          
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{k}\times (S^{1})^{h}}
  . In particular, a connected abelian (real) compact Lie group is a torus; i.e., a Lie group isomorphic to 
  
    
      
        (
        
          S
          
            1
          
        
        
          )
          
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (S^{1})^{h}}
  . A connected complex Lie group that is a compact group is abelian and a connected compact complex Lie group is a complex torus; i.e., a quotient of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              C
            
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {\mathbb {C} } ^{n}}
   by a lattice.
Let A be a compact abelian Lie group with the identity component 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{0}}
  . If 
  
    
      
        A
        
          /
        
        
          A
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A/A_{0}}
   is a cyclic group, then 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is topologically cyclic; i.e., has an element that generates a dense subgroup. (In particular, a torus is topologically cyclic.)
