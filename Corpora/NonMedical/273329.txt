In geometry, a catenoid is a type of surface, arising by rotating a catenary curve about an axis (a surface of revolution). It is a minimal surface, meaning that it occupies the least area when bounded by a closed space. It was formally described in 1744 by the mathematician Leonhard Euler.
Soap film attached to twin circular rings will take the shape of a catenoid. Because they are members of the same associate family of surfaces, a catenoid can be bent into a portion of a helicoid, and vice versa.

The catenoid was the first non-trivial minimal surface in 3-dimensional Euclidean space to be discovered apart from the plane. The catenoid is obtained by rotating a catenary about its directrix. It was found and proved to be minimal by Leonhard Euler in 1744.Early work on the subject was published also by Jean Baptiste Meusnier.: 11106  There are only two minimal surfaces of revolution (surfaces of revolution which are also minimal surfaces): the plane and the catenoid.The catenoid may be defined by the following parametric equations:

where 
  
    
      
        u
        ∈
        [
        −
        π
        ,
        π
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\in [-\pi ,\pi )}
   and 
  
    
      
        v
        ∈
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v\in \mathbb {R} }
   and 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is a non-zero real constant.
In cylindrical coordinates:

where 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is a real constant.
A physical model of a catenoid can be formed by dipping two circular rings into a soap solution and slowly drawing the circles apart.
The catenoid may be also defined approximately by the stretched grid method as a facet 3D model.


== Helicoid transformation ==
Because they are members of the same associate family of surfaces, one can bend a catenoid into a portion of a helicoid without stretching.  In other words, one can make a (mostly) continuous and isometric deformation of a catenoid to a portion of the helicoid such that every member of the deformation family is minimal (having a mean curvature of zero).  A parametrization of such a deformation is given by the system

        (
        u
        ,
        v

        θ

    {\displaystyle \theta =\pi }

    {\displaystyle \theta =\pm \pi /2}
   corresponds to a catenoid, and

  
    
      
        θ
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta =0}
   corresponds to a left-handed helicoid.
