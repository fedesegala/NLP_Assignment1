In algebraic geometry, the Behrend function of a scheme X, introduced by Kai Behrend, is a constructible function

  
    
      
        
          ν
          
            X
          
        
        :
        X
        →
        
          Z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu _{X}:X\to \mathbb {Z} }
  such that if X is a quasi-projective proper moduli scheme carrying a symmetric obstruction theory, then the weighted Euler characteristic

  
    
      
        χ
        (
        X
        ,
        
          ν
          
            X
          
        
        )
        =
        
          ∑
          
            n
            ∈
            
              Z
            
          
        
        n
        
        χ
        (
        {
        
          ν
          
            X
          
        
        =
        n
        }
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi (X,\nu _{X})=\sum _{n\in \mathbb {Z} }n\,\chi (\{\nu _{X}=n\})}
  is the degree of the virtual fundamental class

  
    
      
        [
        X
        
          ]
          
            vir
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle [X]^{\text{vir}}}
  of X, which is an element of the zeroth Chow group of X. Modulo some solvable technical difficulties (e.g., what is the Chow group of a stack?), the definition extends to moduli stacks such as the moduli stack of stable sheaves (the Donaldson–Thomas theory) or that of stable maps (the Gromov–Witten theory).
