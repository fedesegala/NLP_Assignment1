Deer blood is used as a nutritional supplement in some parts of the world, particularly in East Asia.It is often freeze dried to preserve its viability as an ingestible substance, but only after it is sterilized to eradicate biological health threats (such as bacterial infection and parasites, that may reside in the blood while the deer is alive).Freeze dried deer blood is a dark red powder with a high iron content, and is high in protein.
