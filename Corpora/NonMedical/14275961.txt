A great ellipse is an ellipse passing through two points on a spheroid and having the same center as that of the spheroid. Equivalently, it is an ellipse on the surface of a spheroid and centered on the origin, or the curve formed by intersecting the spheroid by a plane through its center.
For points that are separated by less than about a quarter of the circumference of the earth, about 
  
    
      
        10
        
        000
        
        
          k
          m
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 10\,000\,\mathrm {km} }
  , the length of the great ellipse connecting the points is close (within one part in 500,000) to the geodesic distance.
The great ellipse therefore is sometimes proposed as a suitable route for marine navigation.
The great ellipse is special case of an earth section path.


== Introduction ==
Assume that the spheroid, an ellipsoid of revolution, has an equatorial radius 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and polar semi-axis 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  . Define the flattening 
  
    
      
        f
        =
        (
        a
        −
        b
        )
        
          /
        
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle f=(a-b)/a}
  , the eccentricity 
  
    
      
        e
        =
        
          
            f
            (
            2
            −
            f
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e={\sqrt {f(2-f)}}}
  , and the second eccentricity

  . Consider two points: 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   at (geographic) latitude 
  
    
      
        
          ϕ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi _{1}}
   and longitude 
  
    
      
        
          λ

    {\displaystyle \lambda _{1}}
   and 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   at latitude 
  
    
      
        
          ϕ
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi _{2}}
   and longitude 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda _{2}}
  . The connecting great ellipse (from 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   to 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
  ) has length 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            12
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{12}}

There are various ways to map an ellipsoid into a sphere of radius 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   in such a way as to map the great ellipse into a great circle, allowing the methods of great-circle navigation to be used:

The ellipsoid can be stretched in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation; this maps a point of latitude 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   on the ellipsoid to a point on the sphere with latitude 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
  , the parametric latitude.
A point on the ellipsoid can mapped radially onto the sphere along the line connecting it with the center of the ellipsoid; this maps a point of latitude 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   on the ellipsoid to a point on the sphere with latitude 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  , the geocentric latitude.
The ellipsoid can be stretched into a prolate ellipsoid with polar semi-axis 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            2
          
        
        
          /
        
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{2}/b}
   and then mapped radially onto the sphere; this preserves the latitude—the latitude on the sphere is 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
  , the geographic latitude.The last method gives an easy way to generate a succession of way-points on the great ellipse connecting two known points 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   and 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
  . Solve for the great circle between 
  
    
      
        (
        
          ϕ
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          λ
          
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\phi _{1},\lambda _{1})}
   and 
  
    
      
        (
        
          ϕ
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        
          λ
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\phi _{2},\lambda _{2})}
   and find the way-points on the great circle. These map into way-points on the corresponding great ellipse.


== Mapping the great ellipse to a great circle ==
If distances and headings are needed, it is simplest to use the first of the mappings. In detail, the mapping is as follows (this description is taken from ):

The geographic latitude 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   on the ellipsoid maps to the parametric latitude 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
   on the sphere, where
  
    
      
        a
        tan
        ⁡
        β
        =
        b
        tan

        ϕ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\tan \beta =b\tan \phi .}
  
The longitude 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   is unchanged.
The azimuth 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   on the ellipsoid maps to an azimuth 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   on the sphere where

   (from 
  
    
      
        α

  , and

   and the spherical azimuths at the equator and at

    {\displaystyle A}
   and

    {\displaystyle \alpha _{2}}

          γ
          
            1

The semi-axes of the great ellipse can be found using the value of 
  
    
      
        
          γ

Also determined as part of the solution of the great circle problem are the arc lengths, 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            01

            02
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{02}}
  , measured from the equator crossing to 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   and 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}

            12
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{12}}
   is found by computing the length of a portion of perimeter of the ellipse using the formula giving the meridian arc in terms the parametric latitude. In applying this formula, use the semi-axes for the great ellipse (instead of for the meridian) and substitute 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            01

   and 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            02

        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   given 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          α
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{1}}
  , and 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            12
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{12}}
  , can be similarly be found (this requires, in addition, the inverse meridian distance formula). This also enables way-points (e.g., a series of equally spaced intermediate points) to be found in the solution of the inverse problem.
