The geometric set cover problem is the special case of the set cover problem in geometric settings. The input is a range space 
  
    
      
        Σ
        =
        (
        X
        ,
        
          
            R
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma =(X,{\mathcal {R}})}
   where 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a universe of points in 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            d
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}}
   is a family of subsets of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   called ranges, defined by the intersection of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and geometric shapes such as disks and axis-parallel rectangles. The goal is to select a minimum-size subset 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
        ⊆
        
          
            R
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}\subseteq {\mathcal {R}}}
   of ranges such that every point in the universe 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is covered by some range in 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
  .
Given the same range space 
  
    
      
        Σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma }
  , a closely related problem is the geometric hitting set problem, where the goal is to select a minimum-size subset 
  
    
      
        H
        ⊆
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle H\subseteq X}
   of points such that every range of 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}}
   has nonempty intersection with 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
  , i.e., is hit by 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
  .
In the one-dimensional case, where 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   contains points on the real line and 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}}
   is defined by intervals, both the geometric set cover and hitting set problems can be solved in polynomial time using a simple greedy algorithm. However, in higher dimensions, they are known to be NP-complete even for simple shapes, i.e., when 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}}
   is induced by unit disks or unit squares. The discrete unit disc cover problem is a geometric version of the general set cover problem which is NP-hard.Many approximation algorithms have been devised for these problems. Due to the geometric nature, the approximation ratios for these problems can be much better than the general set cover/hitting set problems. Moreover, these approximate solutions can even be computed in near-linear time.


== Approximation algorithms ==
The greedy algorithm for the general set cover problem gives 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        log
        ⁡
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(\log n)}
   approximation, where 
  
    
      
        n
        =
        max
        {
        
          |
        
        X
        
          |
        
        ,
        
          |
        
        
          
            R
          
        
        
          |
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=\max\{|X|,|{\mathcal {R}}|\}}
  .  This approximation is known to be tight up to constant factor. However, in geometric settings, better approximations can be obtained.  Using a multiplicative weight algorithm, Brönnimann and Goodrich showed that an 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        log
        ⁡
        
          
            O
            P
            T
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(\log {\mathsf {OPT}})}
  -approximate set cover/hitting set for a range space 
  
    
      
        Σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma }
   with constant VC-dimension can be computed in polynomial time, where 
  
    
      
        
          
            O
            P
            T
          
        
        ≤
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {OPT}}\leq n}
   denotes the size of the optimal solution. The approximation ratio can be further improved to 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        log
        ⁡
        log
        ⁡
        
          
            O

            T
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(\log \log {\mathsf {OPT}})}
   or 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(1)}
   when 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}}
   is induced by axis-parallel rectangles or disks in 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}
  , respectively.


== Near-linear-time algorithms ==
Based on the iterative-reweighting technique of Clarkson and Brönnimann and Goodrich, Agarwal and Pan gave algorithms that computes an approximate set cover/hitting set of a geometric range space in 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        n
         
        
          p
          o
          l
          y
          l
          o
          g
        
        (
        n
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(n~\mathrm {polylog} (n))}
   time. For example, their algorithms computes an 
  
    
      
        O

            T
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(\log \log {\mathsf {OPT}})}
  -approximate hitting set in

    {\displaystyle O(n\log ^{3}n\log \log \log {\mathsf {OPT}})}
   time for range spaces induced by 2D axis-parallel rectangles; and it computes an

        (
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(1)}
  -approximate set cover in

        ⁡
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(n\log ^{4}n)}
