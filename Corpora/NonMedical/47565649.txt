Haruki's Theorem says that given three intersecting circles that only intersect each other at two points that the lines connecting the inner intersecting points to the outer satisfy:

  
    
      
        
          s
          
            1

    {\displaystyle s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},s_{4},s_{5},s_{6}}
   are the measure of segments connecting the inner and outer intersection points.The theorem is named after the Japanese mathematician Hiroshi Haruki.
