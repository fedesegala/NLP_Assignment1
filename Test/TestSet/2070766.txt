Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) is a term describing a temporary delay in the skeletal growth and thus height of a child with no physical abnormalities causing the delay.  Short stature may be the result of a growth pattern inherited from a parent (familial) or occur for no apparent reason (idiopathic).  Typically at some point during childhood, growth slows down, eventually resuming at a normal rate.  CDGP is the most common cause of short stature and delayed puberty.
