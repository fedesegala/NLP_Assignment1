In mathematics, the dual bundle is an operation on vector bundles extending the operation of duality for vector spaces.


== Definition ==
The dual bundle of a vector bundle 
  
    
      
        π
        :
        E
        →
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi :E\to X}
   is the vector bundle 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            ∗
          
        
        :
        
          E
          
            ∗
          
        
        →
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi ^{*}:E^{*}\to X}
   whose fibers are the dual spaces to the fibers of 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  .
Equivalently, 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E^{*}}
   can be defined as the Hom bundle 
  
    
      
        
          H
          o
          m
        
        (
        E
        ,
        
          R
        
        ×
        X
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Hom} (E,\mathbb {R} \times X),}
   that is, the vector bundle of morphisms from 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   to the trivial line bundle 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
        ×
        X
        →
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \times X\to X.}
  


== Constructions and examples ==
Given a local trivialization of 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   with transition functions 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            i
            j
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{ij},}
   a local trivialization of 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E^{*}}
   is given by the same open cover of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   with transition functions 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            i
            j
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        =
        (
        
          t
          
            i
            j
          
          
            T
          
        
        
          )
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{ij}^{*}=(t_{ij}^{T})^{-1}}
   (the inverse of the transpose). The dual bundle 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E^{*}}
   is then constructed using the fiber bundle construction theorem. As particular cases:

The dual bundle of an associated bundle is the bundle associated to the dual representation of the structure group.
The dual bundle of the tangent bundle of a differentiable manifold is its cotangent bundle.


== Properties ==
If the base space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is paracompact and Hausdorff then a real, finite-rank vector bundle 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   and its dual 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E^{*}}
   are isomorphic as vector bundles. However, just as for vector spaces, there is no natural choice of isomorphism unless 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   is equipped with an inner product.
This is not true in the case of complex vector bundles: for example, the tautological line bundle over the Riemann sphere is not isomorphic to its dual. The dual 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E^{*}}
   of a complex vector bundle 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   is indeed isomorphic to the conjugate bundle 
  
    
      
        
          
            E
            ¯
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overline {E}},}
   but the choice of isomorphism is non-canonical unless 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   is equipped with a hermitian product.
The Hom bundle 
  
    
      
        
          H
          o
          m
        
        (
        
          E
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          E
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Hom} (E_{1},E_{2})}
   of two vector bundles is canonically isomorphic to the tensor product bundle 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            1
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        ⊗
        
          E
          
            2
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle E_{1}^{*}\otimes E_{2}.}
  
Given a morphism 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        
          E
          
            1
          
        
        →
        
          E
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:E_{1}\to E_{2}}
   of vector bundles over the same space, there is a morphism 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            ∗
          
        
        :
        
          E
          
            2
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        →
        
          E
          
            1
          
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{*}:E_{2}^{*}\to E_{1}^{*}}
   between their dual bundles (in the converse order), defined fibrewise as the transpose of each linear map 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            x
          
        
        :
        (
        
          E
          
            1
          
        
        
          )
          
            x
          
        
        →
        (
        
          E
          
            2
          
        
        
          )
          
            x
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{x}:(E_{1})_{x}\to (E_{2})_{x}.}
   Accordingly, the dual bundle operation defines a contravariant functor from the category of vector bundles and their morphisms to itself.
