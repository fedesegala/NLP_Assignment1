The International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference (IPNC) occurs every two years and is a forum for the presentation of cutting-edge research on all aspects of the genus Neisseria. This includes immunology, vaccinology and physiology and metabolism of Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and the commensal species.


== History ==
In the 1970s a series of conferences were held dealing with issues of meningococcal epidemiology and vaccination. Some of these conferences were held in Milano, St. Paul de Vence, and Marseille. But the first official conference was held in San Francisco, California, 1978. The location of the conference switched between North America and Europe until 2006 when the venue was located in Cairns, Australia. Please note that the meeting in South Africa was for the first time both in person and on line, and was delayed from 2020 to 2022.  Subsequently the 2022 meeting in Boston was delayed to 2023.
