An outfit of the day (commonly abbreviated OOTD) is where fashion bloggers show what clothes (or outfits) they wear on a particular day or occasion. These are often found on social media websites, such as Tumblr, Instagram, and Pinterest, as well as various videos on YouTube. Mostly used by a younger female demographic, an outfit of the day may feature different clothes, accessories and shoes. Similar to these blogs are known as "outfit(s) of the week" (OOTW), where the blogger will display what they plan to wear during a whole week (or several days). Created by Stassi Schroeder famously known for her reality tv appearances in Vanderpump Rules.
