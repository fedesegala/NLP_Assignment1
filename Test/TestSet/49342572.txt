Group actions are central to Riemannian geometry and defining orbits (control theory). 
The orbits of computational anatomy consist of anatomical shapes and medical images; the anatomical  shapes are submanifolds of differential geometry consisting of points, curves, surfaces and subvolumes,.
This generalized the ideas of the more familiar orbits of linear algebra which are linear vector spaces.   Medical images are scalar and tensor images from medical imaging. The group actions are used to define models of human shape which accommodate variation. These orbits are deformable templates as originally formulated more abstractly in pattern theory.


== The orbit model of computational anatomy ==
The central model of human anatomy in computational anatomy is  a Groups and group action, a classic formulation from differential geometry.  The orbit is called the space of shapes and forms. The space of shapes are denoted

=== Orientation Distribution Function and High Angular Resolution HARDI ===

Orientation distribution function (ODF) characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules and can be reconstructed from High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI). The ODF is a probability density function defined on a unit sphere,

  . In the field of information geometry, the space of ODF forms a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher-Rao metric. For the purpose of LDDMM ODF mapping, the square-root representation is chosen because it is one of the most efficient representations found to date as the various Riemannian operations, such as geodesics, exponential maps, and logarithm maps, are available in closed form. In the following, denote square-root ODF (
