The Egan Conjecture in the mathematical area of geometry gives a sufficient and necessary condition for the radii of two spheres and the distance of their centers, so that a simplex exists, which is completely contained inside the larger sphere and completely encloses the smaller sphere. The conjecture generalizes an equality discovered by William Chapple (and later independently by Leonard Euler), which is a special case of Poncelet's closure theorem, as well as the Grace–Danielsson Inequality in one dimension higher. The conjecture is named after the Australian mathematician and science-fiction author Greg Egan.

  -simplex), the radius

    {\displaystyle r}
   of its inscribed circle, the radius 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   of its circumcircle and the distance 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
   of their centers are related through Euler's theorem in geometry:

  
    
      
        
          d

    {\displaystyle d^{2}=R(R-2r)}
  ,which was published by William Chapple in 1746 and by Leonard Euler in 1765.For two spheres (

        r
        <

    {\displaystyle r<R}
  , there exists a (non-regular) tetrahedron (

  -simplex), which is completely contained inside the larger sphere and completely encloses the smaller sphere, if and only if the distance 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
   of their centers fulfills the Grace–Danielsson Inequality:

  
    
      
        
          d
          
            2

        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d^{2}\leq (R+r)(R-3r)}
  .This result was independently proven by John Hilton Grace in 1917 and G. Danielsson in 1949. A connection of the inequality with quantum information theory was described by Anthony Milne.

== Status ==
Greg Egan showed that the condition is sufficient under a blog post by John Baez on 16 April 2018. Sergei Drozdov published a paper on ArXiv showing that the condition is also necessary on 16 October 2023.
