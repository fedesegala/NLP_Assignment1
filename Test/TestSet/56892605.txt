The Actinobacteriophage database, more commonly known as PhagesDB, is a website and database that gathers and shares information related to the discovery, characterization and genomics of viruses that prefer to infect Actinobacterial hosts. It is used to compare phages and their genomic annotations. The database provides information on more than 8,000 bacteriophages, including over 1,600 with already sequenced genomes.


== Background ==
PhagesDB provides the Actinobacteriophage research community with a database to post findings for analysis and further research.


== Design and features ==
The creation of PhagesDB was carried out using Django and was hosted on a WebFaction server. The database website opens up with a mostly green and black lobby page and on the top left, a search bar is present. Phage names can be, sequenced and/or draft, typed in the search bar and results immediately pop up.PhagesDB has individual pages for every phage in the database. Along with all these, there is a separate GeneMark page for each phage which allows one to cross reference the position of genomes within the draft phages to ensure that there is indeed a genome present at a certain spot. PhagesDB can be used on its own but is found to be more accurate when used in collaboration with another bio-informatics website like NCBI Blast. The figure below indicates the different types and numbers of phages sequenced:

There are many different ways in PhagesDB where the user is able to view and contact with groups of phages. PhagesDB has amino-acid level details about its phage genomes that are sequenced by integration with Phamerator


== Access and rights to data ==
PhagesDB data can be freely viewed by anyone.
Additionally, the site gives multiple ways of bringing back the fundamental data.An Application Programming Interface (API) is available. PhagesDB keeps some unpublished data that is not present in any medium, including genome sequences that have been done recently.
