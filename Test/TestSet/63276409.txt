In geometry, the Gram–Euler theorem, Gram-Sommerville, Brianchon-Gram or Gram relation (named after Jørgen Pedersen Gram, Leonhard Euler, Duncan Sommerville and Charles Julien Brianchon) is a generalization of the internal angle sum formula of polygons to higher-dimensional polytopes. The equation constrains the sums of the interior angles of a polytope in a manner analogous to the Euler relation on the number of d-dimensional faces. 


== Statement ==
Let 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
   be an 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -dimensional convex polytope. For each k-face 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
  , with 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        dim
        ⁡
        (
        F
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=\dim(F)}
   its dimension (0 for vertices, 1 for edges, 2 for faces, etc., up to n for P itself), its interior (higher-dimensional) solid angle 
  
    
      
        ∠
        (
        F
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \angle (F)}
   is defined by choosing a small enough 
  
    
      
        (
        n
        −
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (n-1)}
  -sphere centered at some point in the interior of 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   and finding the surface area contained inside 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  . Then the Gram–Euler theorem states: In non-Euclidean geometry of constant curvature (i.e. spherical, 
  
    
      
        ϵ
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon =1}
  , and hyperbolic, 
  
    
      
        ϵ
        =
        −
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon =-1}
  , geometry) the relation gains a volume term, but only if the dimension n is even:Here, 
  
    
      
        Vol
        ⁡
        (
        P
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Vol} (P)}
   is the normalized (hyper)volume of the polytope (i.e, the fraction of the n-dimensional spherical or hyperbolic space); the angles 
  
    
      
        ∠
        (
        F
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \angle (F)}
   also have to be expressed as fractions (of the (n-1)-sphere).When the polytope is simplicial additional angle restrictions known as Perles relations hold, analogous to the Dehn-Sommerville equations for the number of faces.

For a two-dimensional polygon, the statement expands into:where the first term 
  
    
      
        A
        =
        
          ∑
          
            α
            
              v
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A=\textstyle \sum \alpha _{v}}
   is the sum of the internal vertex angles, the second sum is over the edges, each of which has internal angle 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
  , and the final term corresponds to the entire polygon, which has a full internal angle

    {\displaystyle 2\pi }
  . For a polygon with 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   faces, the theorem tells us that 
  
    
      
        A
        −
        π
        n
        +

        π
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle A-\pi n+2\pi =0}
  , or equivalently, 
  
    
      
        A
        =
        π
        (
        n
        −
        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle A=\pi (n-2)}
  . For a polygon on a sphere, the relation gives the spherical surface area or solid angle as the spherical excess: 
  
    
      
        Ω
        =
        A
        −
        π
        (
        n
        −
        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega =A-\pi (n-2)}
  .
For a three-dimensional polyhedron the theorem reads:where 
  
    
      
        
          Ω
          
            v
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega _{v}}
   is the solid angle at a vertex, 
  
    
      
        
          θ
          
            e
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta _{e}}
   the dihedral angle at an edge (the solid angle of the corresponding lune is twice as big), the third sum counts the faces (each with an interior hemisphere angle of 
  
    
      
        2
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2\pi }
  ) and the last term is the interior solid angle (full sphere or 
  
    
      
        4
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle 4\pi }
  ).
