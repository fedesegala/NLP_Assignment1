Cultural intelligence or cultural quotient (CQ) describes the ability to adapt to interactions with people from other cultural backgrounds. The concept was introduced by London Business School professor P. Christopher Earley and Nanyang Business School professor Soon Ang in their 2003 textbook Cultural Intelligence: Individual Interactions Across Cultures. The authors stated that while cultural intelligence is comparable to emotional intelligence (EQ), they argued that individuals with a high EQ can grasp "what makes us human and at the same time what makes each of us different from one another," but individuals with a high CQ can discern universal, individual, and non-idiosyncratic features within the behavior of a person or group. They identify behavioral, motivational as well as metacognitive aspects of cultural intelligence.In today's globalized world of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and innovation, cultural intelligence (CQ) is essential for differentiating oneself. It is more than just being sensitive to and aware of cultural differences; it is the capacity to interact and collaborate productively with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. Knowing how to strategically leverage cultural differences to generate more creative solutions is a sign of cultural intelligence.

Teaching facts about various cultures—such as Indians versus Germans or Millennials versus Boomers—is the main goal of the majority of cultural competency programs. A distinct strategy is used for cultural intelligence. We know that in order to effectively relate to and collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds, four capabilities must be developed based on over 20 years of research conducted in more than 100 countries.
CQ Drive—the interest and drive required to collaborate effectively with others—is the foundation of cultural intelligence. The next concept is CQ Knowledge, or knowing the kinds of distinctions that characterize one group from another without utilizing cultural stereotypes. Learning how to effectively plan in light of cultural differences is the third strategy, or CQ Strategy. The final characteristic is CQ Action, which is the capacity to modify behavior when necessary.
Why is CQ Important?
You can diagnose and react to complicated situations involving different cultures quickly with the help of CQ. CQ is a tool that can help you succeed in any intercultural situation, as opposed to applying stereotypes and learning facts about culture.
CQ'S BENEFITS FOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
• Highly interculturally competent instructors, staff, and students
• Superior Exchanges with a Variety of People
• A multitude of professional options
• A welcoming and diverse campus or learning environment
•Study abroad initiatives that are revolutionary
• Attracting and keeping underrepresented faculty, staff, and students
• Cost savings and efficiencies, both tangible and intangible.


== Four CQ capabilities ==
The authors describe four CQ capabilities: motivation (CQ Drive), cognition (CQ Knowledge), meta-cognition (CQ Strategy), and behavior (CQ Action).  CQ Assessments reports score on all four capabilities as well as several sub-dimensions for each capability. The four capabilities stem from the intelligence-based approach to intercultural adjustment and performance.
