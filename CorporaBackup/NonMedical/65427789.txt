A cowl neck is a neckline consisting of a loose draped fabric collar. The term can describe the neckline of a wide variety of garments, from the draped neckline of an evening gown to a raised neckline of knitwear similar to a turtleneck. The neckline was introduced in the 1920s by Madeleine Vionnet based on her study of ancient Grecian sculptures. The style is named for the cowl, a feature of monastic dress that serves as both a collar and a hood.
