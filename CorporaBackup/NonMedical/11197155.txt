A partial linear space (also semilinear or near-linear space) is a basic incidence structure in the field of incidence geometry, that carries slightly less structure than a linear space.
The notion is equivalent to that of a linear hypergraph.


== Definition ==
Let 
  
    
      
        S
        =
        (
        
          
            P
          
        
        ,
        
          
            L
          
        
        ,
        
          
            I
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S=({\mathcal {P}},{\mathcal {L}},{\textbf {I}})}
   an incidence structure, for which the elements of 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}
   are called points and the elements of 
  
    
      
        
          
            L
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}
   are called lines. S is a partial linear space, if the following axioms hold:

any line is incident with at least two points
any pair of distinct points is incident with at most one lineIf there is a unique line incident with every pair of distinct points, then we get a linear space. 


== Properties ==
The De Bruijn–Erdős theorem shows that in any finite linear space 
  
    
      
        S
        =
        (
        
          
            P
          
        
        ,
        
          
            L
          
        
        ,
        
          
            I
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S=({\mathcal {P}},{\mathcal {L}},{\textbf {I}})}
   which is not a single point or a single line, we have 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          
            P
          
        
        
          |
        
        ≤
        
          |
        
        
          
            L
          
        
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |{\mathcal {P}}|\leq |{\mathcal {L}}|}
  .
