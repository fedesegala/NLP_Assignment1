After the festival of 2006 in Tong district, Kyrgyzstan, international reactions to the violence of the event led the Salburun Federation to rethink the rules and take measures for animal defense. In 2015, a petition has been launched to end wolf baiting.Salburun is one of the World Nomad Games' disciplines.
