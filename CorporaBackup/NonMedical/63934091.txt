In mathematics, and especially algebraic geometry, a Bridgeland stability condition, defined by Tom Bridgeland, is an algebro-geometric stability condition defined on elements of a triangulated category. The case of original interest and particular importance is when this triangulated category is the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi–Yau manifold, and this situation has fundamental links to string theory and the study of D-branes.
Such stability conditions were introduced in a rudimentary form by Michael Douglas called 
  
    
      
        Π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Pi }
  -stability and used to study BPS B-branes in string theory. This concept was made precise by Bridgeland, who phrased these stability conditions categorically, and initiated their study mathematically.


== Definition ==
The definitions in this section are presented as in the original paper of Bridgeland, for arbitrary triangulated categories. Let 
  
    
      
        
          
            D
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}}
   be a triangulated category.

=== Elliptic curves ===
There is an analysis by Bridgeland for the case of Elliptic curves. He finds there is an equivalence
