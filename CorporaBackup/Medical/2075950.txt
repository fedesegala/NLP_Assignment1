In anatomy, a process (Latin: processus) is a projection or outgrowth of tissue from a larger body. For instance, in a vertebra, a process may serve for muscle attachment and leverage (as in the case of the transverse and spinous processes), or to fit (forming a synovial joint), with another vertebra (as in the case of the articular processes). The word is also used at the microanatomic level, where cells can have processes such as cilia or pedicels. Depending on the tissue, processes may also be called by other terms, such as apophysis, tubercle, or protuberance.

Examples of processes include:

The many processes of the human skull:
The mastoid and styloid processes of the temporal bone
The zygomatic process of the temporal bone
The zygomatic process of the frontal bone
The orbital, temporal, lateral, frontal, and maxillary processes of the zygomatic bone
The anterior, middle, and posterior clinoid processes and the petrosal process of the sphenoid bone
The uncinate process of the ethmoid bone
The jugular process of the occipital bone
The alveolar, frontal, zygomatic, and palatine processes of the maxilla
The ethmoidal and maxillary processes of the inferior nasal concha
The pyramidal, orbital, and sphenoidal processes of the palatine bone
The coronoid and condyloid processes of the mandible
The xiphoid process at the end of the sternum
The acromion and coracoid processes of the scapula
The coronoid process of the ulna
The radial and ulnar styloid processes
The uncinate processes of ribs found in birds and reptiles
The uncinate process of the pancreas
The spinous, articular, transverse, accessory, uncinate, and mammillary processes of the vertebrae
The trochlear process of the heel
The appendix, which is sometimes called the "vermiform process", notably in Gray's Anatomy
