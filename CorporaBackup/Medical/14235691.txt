The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to genetics:
Genetics â€“ science of genes, heredity, and variation in living organisms. Genetics deals with the molecular structure and function of genes, and gene behavior in  context of a cell or organism (e.g. dominance and epigenetics),  patterns of inheritance from parent to offspring, and  gene distribution, variation and change in populations.
